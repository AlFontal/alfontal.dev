    "text": "Abstract\nKawasaki Disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis that mainly affects children younger than 5 years old. Although KD cases have been registered in over 60 countries across several continents, its incidence is highest in East Asia, particularly in Japan, where the highest annual incidence rate was recorded in 2018: 359 cases per 100 000 children aged 0-4 years [1]. After more than five decades since its discovery, the etiology of KD is yet to be elucidated. Past studies have analyzed the association between KD and diverse environmental factors, with some advances pointing towards a relevant role of the atmospheric transport of a wind-borne agent as trigger of KD [2, 3]. The epidemiological records of KD in Japan show an increasing incidence trend and a marked seasonality, prompting questions about the nature of the drivers of these changes in incidence. In this work, we focus on updated records from Tokyo prefecture (2011-2018) to find an association with specific air source locations and higher incidence seasons."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe roles of climate and true seasonal signatures in the epidemiology of emergent pathogens, and that of SARS-CoV-2 in particular, remain poorly understood. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show, for COVID-19 cases, strong consistent negative effects of both temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions, we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified in the first two waves, suggesting clear ranges for temperature and absolute humidity that are similar to those formerly described for seasonal influenza. For COVID-19, in all studied regions and pandemic waves, a process-based model that incorporates a temperature-dependent transmission rate outperforms baseline formulations with no driver or a sinusoidal seasonality. Our results, so far, classify COVID-19 as a seasonal low-temperature infection and suggest an important contribution of the airborne pathway in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with implications for the control measures we discuss."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nSignificance\nAtmospheric aircraft monitoring with 10 tropospheric flights over the planetary boundary layer in Japan (between 1,000 m and 3,000 m above sea-level) demonstrate the presence of viable bacteria and fungi harmful to humans. Long-distance transport for over 2,000 km is possible in the free troposphere for air masses originating in agricultural regions enriched in fertilizers and pesticides.\n\n\nAbstract\nThe existence of viable human pathogens in bioaerosols which can cause infection or affect human health has been the subject of little research. In this study, data provided by 10 tropospheric aircraft surveys over Japan in 2014 confirm the existence of a vast diversity of microbial species up to 3,000 m height, which can be dispersed above the planetary boundary layer over distances of up to 2,000 km, thanks to strong winds from an area covered with massive cereal croplands in Northeast (NE) Asia.\nMicrobes attached to aerosols reveal the presence of diverse bacterial and fungal taxa, including potential human pathogens, originating from sewage, pesticides, or fertilizers. Over 266 different fungal and 305 bacterial genera appeared in the 10 aircraft transects. Actinobacteria, Bacillota, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes phyla dominated the bacteria composition and, for fungi, Ascomycota prevailed over Basidiomycota.\nAmong the pathogenic species identified, human pathogens include bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Cutibacterium acnes, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Shigella sonnei, Haemophillus parainfluenzae and Acinetobacter baumannii and health-relevant fungi such as Malassezia restricta, Malassezia globosa, Candida parapsilosis and Candida zeylanoides, Sarocladium kiliense, Cladosporium halotolerans, and Cladosporium herbarum.\nDiversity estimates were similar at heights and surface when entrainment of air from high altitudes occurred. Natural antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) cultured from air samples were found indicating long-distance spread of ARB and microbial viability. This would represent a novel way to disperse both viable human pathogens and resistance genes among distant geographical regions."

    "section": "The site",
    "text": "The site\nThe reason I decided to create this website was to showcase my blog and my portfolio, as I am finishing my PhD and I want to make a good impression on potential employers and colleagues. I also want to demonstrate my skills and experience in my field and have some fun with web development.\n\nBackground on reporting via static pages\nI have been playing around with technical reporting for a good while now, since I started to need to share my data analysis reports with other (technical and non-technical) folks.\nMost of the times my reports are done via Jupyter notebooks, but I have never liked the default renders that both Github and Gitlab provide, as I feel the lack of proper navigation tools and the ability to show rich outputs and hide code cells really hinders the readability of the notebooks and directly scares away non-technical readers. Because of this, I started to look for static-page generators that could render my notebooks into nicely formatted html pages that I could customize to my liking.\n\n(1) Pelican and Gitlab Pages\nThe first static page generator I tried was pelican, which offers a variety of site themes using Jinja2 templates and can render notebooks by using the pelican-jupyter plugin.\nAt this point in time we were using a self-hosted Gitlab server in my old company, so we used Gitlab Pages and its integrated CI/CD (Github Actions did not exist yet and people were still using Travis CI to handle CI/CD on Github). I didn’t really fully understand the magic behind Gitlab’s CI/CD at that point and I was a bit scared of messing up the configuration by modifying too much the .gitlab-ci.yml file at that point, so I mantained this setup for a while, even after leaving the company. The fact that Gitlab offered free private repositories (unlike Github at that point) was also a factor in my decision to use Gitlab as my main git hosting service.\n\n\n(2) Jupyterbook\nAfter a while, I discovered the Jupyterbook project. I saw several projects using it and I was really impressed by the results.\n\n\nSome really cool projects I found using Jupyterbook are:\n\nPython Causality Handbook\nThe Turing Way\nQuantEcon\n\nI decided to give it a try and moved all my reporting to Jupyterbook, which seemed to perfectly integrate with my .ipynb reports. With the introduction of free private repositories on Github and the introduction of Github Actions, I started to migrate most of my projects to Github, using Github Pages to host the site.\nA problem with the free hosting by Github Pages is that while the repositories might be private, the sites are not, so anyone with the link can access the site. This is not a problem for some of my projects, but it is for some others, where I need to be sure that there is some kind of Authentication in place to be able to access my reports. It’s because of that that for a good while I mixed both Gitlab and Github for my projects.\nAs far as I know, Github now supports private sites hosted in Github Pages but only for Enterprise accounts, which is not an option for me at this point.\n\n\n(3) Quarto and Netlify\nAs mainly a Python developer but also a R user, I was always a bit jealous of the R community and the whole ecosystem around Rmarkdown and projects such as bookdown. The beautiful sites that people were able to create with bookdown were really impressive and I always wanted to be able to do something similar with Python.\nIt was then a happy surprise when I discovered that the RStudio project had rebranded itself as Posit, and part of the change is the will to embrace other languages and ecosystems, mainly the Python community. I was really excited to see that they were working on a new project called Quarto, which is a new static site generator that can render notebooks and markdown files into beautiful html pages. This solution seemed to be the perfect fit for my needs, as it would allow me to use the same .ipynb files I was already using for my Jupyterbook reports, but with the added benefit of being able to collaborate with colleagues using Rmarkdown files interchangeably! On top of that, having a big team behind the project and the fact that it is backed by a big company such as RStudio made me feel more confident about the future of the project.\nI migrated all my project rendering to Quarto and started to tinker and explore its features. I was really happy with the results, and learnt a lot about HTML, CSS and even Javascript in the process.\nI also ended up reworking the old Wordpress Site of my consortium HELICAL ITN, into a Quarto site (which you can visit in helical-itn.eu).\nAfter that, I also started to explore the web hosting options available by Netlify, which seemed to be a really good fit for my needs. While Github Pages is easy and works, the customization options are quite limited and I was not able to find a way to add any kind of authentication to my site. Netlify, on the other hand, offers a lot of customization on this regard and it is really easy to set up and use.\n\n\nCurrent Workflow\nWith all that unnecessary background information out of the way, I can finally get to the point of my post and my current workflow for the site (and most of my reporting projects):\n\n\n\nSchematic view of current deployment workflow\n\n\nBasically, what I do is:\n\nEdit my reports or sites on either .ipynb or .qmd format. I can pre-render the results locally using quarto render\nWhen I am happy with the results I push to the main branch in Github.\nThis triggers the Github Actions workflow that builds the environment, installs the dependencies (using poetry and caching them for re-runs) and then uses quarto to render the HTML pages.\nThe rendered pages are then commited to a separate branch in the same repo, site-html.\nI configure Netlify to deploy the site-html branch to the site, so when the branch is updated, Netlify will automatically deploy the new version of the site on the custom domain I have configured and with the access restrictions I have set up.\n\nI am pretty happy with this workflow, as it allows me to have a single source of truth for my reports and sites, while still being able to use the tools I am most comfortable with. We’ll see how long this lasts."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe continuously decreasing cost of sequencing genomes is promoting the generation of vast amounts of sequence data. In consequence, the need to develop automated methods of analysis for this kind of data is on the rise. A first step towards inferring a protein’s function is to know its subcellular location. In this thesis we explore the capabilities of modern machine learning techniques, and more specifically deep learning models to predict the subcellular location of proteins only using their amino acid sequence as predictor."

    "text": "Abstract\nMany theories have been formulated through decades regarding the causes of the mysterious syndrome known as Kawasaki disease (KD). This pediatric self-limited vasculitis has been escaping full characterization since Tomizaku Kawasaki, PhD, identified the disease that was then named after him. In many of the clinical histories, the role of external factors seems already clear, because the appearance of respiratory symptoms is reported to occur a few days before KD symptoms emerge (eg, an abnormal immune response characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the acute phase). However, the many attempts to characterize a unique agent have been unsuccessful so far. Whether this is an indication of a multiplicity of agents (ie, multiple-agent disease) or a complex interplay of factors interacting with the immune system of children who are genetically predisposed still remains an open question. However, in this race against time, a study by Hara and colleagues4 takes advantage of the unique epidemiological situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan to perform a natural experiment that sheds new light on the hidden etiological processes of KD."

    "text": "Abstract\nAir pollution (urban, industrial or rural) has been linked to a myriad of human ailments despite clear mechanistic associations that are often not thoroughly established. Daily variability of fine aerosols in a surveillance campaign in south Japan shows a striking coevolution between their trace elements (metal and metalloid, MM) content and Kawasaki disease (KD) admissions, suggesting a strong dynamical link. These aerosol MM could instigate an immune response that, along with genetic susceptibility, would lead to KD development. This association may account for over 40% of the total variability in the disease, being dominated by a clear sub-weekly cycle (SWC1). Thanks to both an unprecedented daily KD epidemiological record going back to 1970, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric backscattering profiles for the interval 2010–2016 and HYSPLIT simulations with numerous sensitivity analyses, we can trace this SWC1 variability to occur concomitantly from sub-seasonal to interannual timescales in both KD and aerosols. This SWC1 appears to connect or disconnect Japan to air intrusions from above the planetary boundary layer (PBL), having their source in industrial and agricultural areas in NE Asia and points to a stronger case for an agricultural source for the exposure as opposed to urban pollution. The KD maxima always occur in full synchrony with the arrival of very small (&lt;1 µm; PM1) particles showing that ultrafine aerosols appear as a necessary cofactor in the occurrence of KD and sets the field to associate other similar human diseases. Our study shows how signal-detection approaches can be useful to uncover hidden associations between the environment and human health, otherwise unnoticed and help set new early-warning systems for disease prevention."
